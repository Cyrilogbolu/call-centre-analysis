# 📞 Call Centre Analytics with Power BI

This project analyzes sample call center data using **Power BI** to derive insights into agent performance, call resolution rates, customer satisfaction, and response efficiency. The focus goes beyond building beautiful dashboards—it's about asking the right business questions and delivering actionable insights.

## 🧠 Objective

To understand call patterns, optimize agent performance, and identify factors impacting customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following fields:

- `call id`
- `agent`
- `date`
- `time`
- `topic`
- `answered (Y/N)`
- `resolved`
- `speed of answer (seconds)`
- `talk duration`
- `satisfaction rating`

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** for data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard visualization
- **DAX** for creating custom measures and calculated columns
- **Power Query** for data transformation

## 🔧 Key Features & DAX Measures

- Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query
- Created dynamic DAX measures including:
  - Average Speed of Answer
  - Average Talk Duration
  - Percentage of Resolved Calls
  - Satisfaction Trend Over Time
- Built interactive dashboards with filters for:
  - Agent
  - Topic
  - Day of the Week
  - Resolution Status

## 📊 Key Insights

- 📌 Technical Support generated the most calls, often with average satisfaction ratings  
- 📌 Shorter wait times generally correlated with higher satisfaction  
- 📌 First-call resolutions led to better customer experiences  
- 📌 Some agents managed more diverse call topics but needed support to improve resolution rates

## 💡 Takeaway

This project reinforces a key principle in data analysis:  
**Insight is more valuable than aesthetics.**  

A dashboard may look beautiful, but its true worth lies in the story it tells and the decisions it informs. By aligning analytics with real business needs, we move closer to meaningful outcomes.
